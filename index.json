However, few studies have considered the child’s early attachment organization and receptive, positive orientation in the context of early relationships with both the mother and the father. Further, few studies have compared all four main attachment groups (secure, avoidant, resistant, and disorganized), and utilized multiple observational measures of children’s receptive, positive orientation toward each parent. In 192 mother-child and 186 father-child dyads from community families, children’s attachment was assessed at 15-17 months in Strange Situation Paradigm. Aspects of receptive, positive orientation toward each parent – positive affect, committed compliance, empathic concern, and restraint in response to parental prohibition – were observed in naturalistic laboratory contexts. Generally, securely attached children were more receptive and positive than insecure, although specific effects depended on the measure, comparison group (avoidant, resistant, disorganized), and the relationship (mother- or father-child). For positive orientation in the father-child dyad, being secure with both parents conferred a modest additional benefit.","tags":["attachment","positive affect","committed compliance","empathy","restraint","mother-child relationship","father-child relationship"],"title":"Children’s Emerging Receptive, Positive Orientation toward Their Parents in the Network of Early Attachment Relationships","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Flora Farago","Jingyi Xu","Natalie D Eggum-Wilkens","Linlin Zhang","Danming An","Eunjung Kim","Emily Adams"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1612841820,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612841820,"objectID":"fb9d9c6ddc12c4143bc0c2126578945b","permalink":"http://danmingan.github.io/publication/2021ys/","publishdate":"2021-02-08T21:37:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2021ys/","section":"publication","summary":"Ugandan adolescents (n = 202, 54% girls; Mage = 14.26) answered closed- and open-ended questions about the gender composition of friends and attitudes about, and activities with, same- and other-gender peers and friends.

We examined features of parents’ representations of their infants – adaptive (appropriate mind-mindedness, MM) and dysfunctional (low reflective functioning, RF, hostile attributions) – as potential moderators. In Family Study (N = 102), we tested parents’ appropriate MM comments to their infants as moderating a path from infants’ observed difficulty (negative affect, unresponsiveness) to parents’ observed power assertion at ages 2–4.5 to children's observed and parent-rated (dis)regard for conduct rules at age 5.5. In father–child relationships, MM moderated that path: for fathers with low MM, the infants’ increasing difficulty was associated with fathers’ greater power assertion, which in turn was associated with children's more disregard for rules. The path was absent for fathers with average or high MM. In Children and Parents Study (N = 200), dysfunctional representations (low RF, hostile attributions) moderated the link between child objective difficulty, observed as anger in laboratory episodes, and difficulty as described by the parent. Reports of mothers with highly dysfunctional representations were unrelated to children's observed anger. Reports of mothers with average or low dysfunctional representations aligned with laboratory observations.","tags":["parenting","temperament","socio-emotional development"],"title":"Parents' Early Representations of Their Children Moderate Socialization Processes: Evidence from Two Studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Danming An","Grazyna Kochanska"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1596866183,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596866183,"objectID":"cbc110623cdefed7ae832ce17add41a7","permalink":"http://danmingan.github.io/publication/2020dpp_a/","publishdate":"2020-08-08T00:56:23-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2020dpp_a/","section":"publication","summary":"Individual differences in two inhibitory temperament systems have been implicated as key in the development of early disruptive behaviors. The reactive inhibition system, behavioral inhibition (BI) entails fearfulness, shyness, timidity, and caution. The active inhibition system, or effortful control (EC) entails a capacity to deliberately suppress, modify, or regulate a predominant behavior. Lower scores in each system have been associated with more disruptive behaviors. We examined how the two systems interact, and whether one can alleviate or exacerbate risks due to the other. In two community samples (Study 1, N = 112, ages 2.5 to 4, and Study 2, N = 102, ages 2 to 6.5), we assessed early BI and EC, and future disruptive behaviors (observed disregard for rules in Study 1 and parent-rated externalizing problems in Study 2). Robustly replicated interactions revealed that for children with low BI (relatively fearless), better EC was associated with less disruptive behavior; for children with low EC, more BI was associated with less disruptive behavior. This research extends the investigation of temperament x temperament interactions in developmental psychology and psychopathology, and it suggests that reactive and active inhibition systems may play mutually compensatory roles. Those effects emerged after age 2.","tags":["behavioral inhibition","effortful control","socio-emotional development","temperament"],"title":"Mutual Synergies between Reactive and Active Inhibitory Systems of Temperament in the Development of Children’s Disruptive Behavior: Two Longitudinal Studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Natalie D Eggum-Wilkens","Danming An","Linlin Zhang","Megan Costa"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577869351,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577869351,"objectID":"486beeb20027b7b7523f82649a061e20","permalink":"http://danmingan.github.io/publication/2020sode/","publishdate":"2020-07-25T04:02:31-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2020sode/","section":"publication","summary":"We investigated the co‐occurrence of and cross‐informant agreement on early adolescents’ shyness, unsociability, and avoidance measured by self‐ and peer reports for fifth to eighth graders (N = 383; 51% male) in the United States.

Longitudinally, T1 shyness (but not individualism, collectivism, or academic achievement) predicted T2 depressive symptoms after controlling for stability in depressive symptoms. Concurrent relations between shyness and depressive symptoms were moderated by adolescents’ cultural orientations. Specifically, collectivism was protective whereas individualism was harmful, for shy adolescents’ adjustment. Furthermore, collectivism and academic achievement jointly moderated the relations between shyness and depressive symptoms concurrently and longitudinally.

These motivations may differ across cultures. The purpose of this study was to explore Ugandan adolescents' descriptions of solitude and social withdrawal, with the aim of guiding future research on social withdrawal in Uganda.\nMethods: Ugandan adolescents' (M = 14.23 years old, SD = 1.63 years) descriptions of solitude and social withdrawal were investigated in a cross-sectional, exploratory study. The sample (N = 219 [106 girls, 90 boys, 23 missing sex data]) was drawn from two primary schools and a secondary school in Eastern Uganda. Adolescents' responses to open-ended questionnaire items about general solitude, conflicted motivations for social withdrawal, and non-conflicted motivation for social withdrawal were coded and categorized.\nResults: Some of the adolescents' descriptions were consistent with the literature. For example, they described shyness and internalizing emotions, externalizing and socially incompetent behaviors, and poor peer relationships. Some descriptions were unique and likely reflected Uganda's challenges, for instance, family or household factors such as being an orphan.\nConclusions: Results underscored the importance of exploring contextual processes (e.g., parental loss) that might affect Ugandan adolescents' solitude. More generally, the results suggested that solitude should be researched using a broad, synergistic lens that incorporates potential determinants from adolescents and their environments at multiple levels (e.g., person, peer, household, culture).","tags":["socio-emotional development","culture","social withdrawal"],"title":"An Exploratory Study of Eastern Ugandan Adolescents’ Descriptions of Social Withdrawal","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Danming An","Natalie D Eggum-Wilkens","Sophia Chae","Sarah R Hayford","Scott T Yabiku","Jennifer E Glick","Linlin Zhang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1519893835,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519893835,"objectID":"20bfa4f2bc887e74f890fbed70be4f2a","permalink":"http://danmingan.github.io/publication/2018pds/","publishdate":"2020-07-25T03:43:55-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018pds/","section":"publication","summary":" Adults in Nepal (N = 14) and Malawi (N = 12) were interviewed about their views regarding social competence of 5- to 17-year-old children in their societies.

This study aims to further clarify this relation by demonstrating what has long been posited by parental acceptance/rejection theory but never validated empirically—namely that adolescents’ unique or subjective experience of parental rejection independently informs their future adjustment. Among a longitudinal, multi-informant sample of 161 families (early adolescents were 47 % female and 40 % European American) this study utilized a multitrait–multimethod confirmatory factor analysis to isolate for each early adolescent–parent dyad, the adolescent’s distinct view of parental rejection (i.e., the adolescent unique perspective) from the portion of his or her view that overlaps with his or her parent’s view. The findings indicated that adolescents’ unique perspectives of maternal rejection were not differentiated from their unique perspectives of paternal rejection. Also, consistent with parental acceptance–rejection theory, early adolescents’ unique perspectives of parental rejection were associated with worse adjustment (internalizing and externalizing) 1 year later. This study further demonstrates the utility and validity of the multitrait–multimethod confirmatory factor analysis approach for identifying and examining adolescent unique perspectives. Both conceptually and analytically, this study also integrates research focused on unique perspectives with a distinct but related line of research focused on discrepancies in perspectives.\nA","tags":["parenting"],"title":"Early Adolescents’ Unique Perspectives of Maternal and Paternal Rejection: Examining Their Across-Dyad Generalizability and Relations with Adjustment 1 Year Later","type":"publication"}]
